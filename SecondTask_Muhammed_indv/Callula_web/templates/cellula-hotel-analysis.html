                    <p>This density plot shows the distribution of average prices based on the number of adults in a booking. Prices for 0-2 adults are clustered around lower values, likely representing standard rooms. Bookings for 3-4 adults show a wider spread and higher average prices, possibly indicating larger rooms or suites. There's a noticeable overlap in price ranges, suggesting flexibility in room assignments based on occupancy.</p>

                    <p>This time series graph illustrates the fluctuations in average booking prices over time. Clear seasonal patterns are visible, with peaks occurring around September each year. The highest peak is observed in September 2018, indicating a potential high season or special event. Troughs typically appear in the winter months, suggesting lower demand during this period. There's an overall upward trend in prices from 2017 to 2018, which could indicate growing popularity or inflation.</p>

                    <p>Andrews Curves provide a way to visualize multidimensional data. The red curves represent non-canceled bookings, while green curves show canceled bookings. The symmetry in the curves suggests some consistency in booking patterns. The divergence between red and green curves at certain points may indicate factors that influence cancellations. The complexity of the curves implies that multiple variables affect booking and cancellation behaviors.</p>

                    <p>This treemap visualizes the distribution of different room types. Room Type 1 is overwhelmingly the most common, accounting for about 75% of all rooms. Room Types 4 and 6 are the next most frequent, but significantly less common than Type 1. Room Types 2, 5, 7, and 3 are relatively rare, possibly representing specialty or luxury options. The hotel might consider diversifying its room offerings or investigating why Type 1 is so dominant.</p>

'Not Selected' is the second most common option, indicating many guests opt out of meal plans. Meal Plan 2 is chosen by a small but significant number of guests. Meal Plan 3 is rarely selected, suggesting it might be a premium option or not well-promoted. The hotel could investigate why so many guests choose not to select a meal plan and consider adjusting their offerings.</p>

                            <li>There's a slight trend of higher prices for bookings made further in advance (longer lead times).</li>
                            <li>Bookings with more special requests (darker colors) tend to have higher average prices.</li>
                            <li>The majority of bookings cluster in the 0-200 day lead time range and $50-$250 price range.</li>
                            <li>There are some outliers with very high prices, particularly for shorter lead times.</li>

                        This information can be useful for pricing strategies and understanding the relationship between advance bookings, special requests, and pricing.</p>
